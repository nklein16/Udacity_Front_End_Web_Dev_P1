# Udacity - Front End Web Development, Project 1

The first project in the Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree is to build a portfolio website of work and projects that we have completed from scratch using HTML and CSS.  The intention is that we can continue to build out our portfolio as we move through the program.  This is mine thus far.
